## I/O

# Increase VFS read-ahead
# Default: 64
#vfs.read_max=256

# Unbound needs big socket buffers
#kern.ipc.maxsockbuf=10000000

## Settings for FreeBSD as a router
# A speedup of 40 to 60% in packet forwarding performance!
#net.inet.ip.forwarding=1
#net.inet.ip.fastforwarding=1
# 3900 seconds allows clients who connect regularly to stay in our hostcache
#net.inet.tcp.hostcache.expire=3900
# The OS buffer / backlog queue depth for accepting new TCP connections
#kern.ipc.somaxconn=1024

# maximum segment size (MSS) specifies the largest amount of data in a single TCP segment
# For most networks 1460 is optimal, but you may want to be cautious and use
# 1440. This smaller MSS allows an extra 20 bytes of space for those client which are on a
# DSL line which may use PPPoE. These networks have extra header data stored in
# the packet and if there is not enough space, must be fragmented over additional
# partially filled packets.
# Default: 536
net.inet.tcp.mssdflt=1440

# Loopback interface tuning

# Syncookies are only useful when under DOS attack
net.inet.tcp.syncookies=0
# If under DOS, set it to 1
# Also, uncomment the following:

# disable flow control for intel nics. many isp's abuse flow control to slow down
# customers even though you are not using your full bandwidth. (default 3)

net.inet.tcp.always_keepalive=0       # tcp keep alive detection for dead peers, can be spoofed (default 1)
net.inet.tcp.drop_synfin=1            # SYN/FIN packets get dropped on initial connection (default 0)
#net.inet.tcp.fast_finwait2_recycle=1  # recycle FIN/WAIT states quickly (helps against DoS, but may cause false RST) (default 0)
net.inet.tcp.icmp_may_rst=0           # icmp may not send RST to avoid spoofed icmp/udp floods (default 1)
net.inet.tcp.msl=15000                # 15s maximum segment life waiting for an ACK in reply to a SYN-ACK or FIN-ACK (default 30000)
